# Pokemon-App
Pokemon-App is an application that receives a list of data from the Internet, converts them into a table and, as the table is filled, loads the data into the database. The application includes several states:
1) The Internet is available (can be seen in the upper right corner), in this case, uploading a Pokemon photo is supported

2) The Internet is not available, the data comes to the application from the database, as evidenced by the icon in the right corner, the photo is missing due to the large amount of information, which greatly slows down the application
